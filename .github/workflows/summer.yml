# ‚úñÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è Temporarily disabled: automatic configuration updates ‚úñÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Reason:
#   Cloudflare Warp configurations are currently blocked in certain regions
#   (notably Iran and China). The automatic update process in this workflow
#   replaces not only endpoints, but also critical fields such as
#   private_key, reserved, mtu, and address ‚Äî which breaks connectivity
#   when regionally restricted.
#
# Action:
#   This workflow is intentionally commented out (disabled) to prevent
#   overwriting the manually working configuration. I will manually set
#   the following IPs/domains, Private Keys, Addresses and related parameters
#   until the restrictions are lifted.
#
# Working configuration (manually applied):
#   ‚Ä¢ IPv4 range: 162.159.192.1 ‚Äî 162.159.192.20
#   ‚Ä¢ IPv4 range: 162.159.195.1 ‚Äî 162.159.195.10
#   ‚Ä¢ IPv6 range: 2606:4700:d0::a29f:c001 ‚Äî 2606:4700:d0::a29f:c014
#   ‚Ä¢ Custom domain: wire.nscl.ir
#
# Important:
#   ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT re-enable or edit this workflow to auto-replace configs
#   while these regional blocks remain active.
#
# Re-enable procedure:
#   You can still run it manually from actions, But if you want to re-enable:
#   1. Verify that Cloudflare/Warp endpoints are accessible again
#      from affected regions (Iran/China).
#   2. Uncomment this section to restore the workflow:
#      lines 39, 40 ... and 45.
#   3. Test connectivity in staging before pushing to production.
